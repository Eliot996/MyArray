# Exercise w5.1
- During class, we made some code where we used an array of integers. 
  - We added a method to automatically increase the length of the array when needed. 
  Then we exported the code to a new class MyArray that implemets an array that automatically 
  increases its length when needed, and some extra methods to add() elements and to get() elements, 
  and to get the length size() of the array.
- Now the exercise is to improve the MyArray class:–
  - Add an add(i, e) method to add elements at position “i”
  - Add a remove(i) method to remove an element at position “i”
  - Add a clear() method to erase all elements
